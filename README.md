This project is build as an interface with mock data.

The requests are artifitialy delayed by 1 second to showcase a network call. All the data is "fethced" and saved in a local database if the device has a connection to the internet. 1 transaction is artifitialy added to the transactions list when it is refreshed via swipe up to simulate a real update.
If the device does not have a connection to the internet, an indicator shows which allows you to make the "request" again.
